## Vim Notes Start to End

I've tried to create these notes, making it a one-stop-shop for all vim needs, from quick commands to the philosophy behind the text editor. Many of the things which I found to be awesome in vim, are somehow not part of most of the popular tutorials, which I feel is a large reason for which many people are averse to using the editor. 

Hopefully these notes will make you want to use vim, or start using vim bindings within any editor of your choice (evil modes!). 

Please add issues or pull requests if you find any errors or typos. I've added the latex source as well in case anyone would like to extend it in any way. Cheers!
